- Learn how to interview patients by asking accurate medical questions. It is said that a well-performed interview is 90% of medical diagnosis. Our AI algorithm allows you to ask patients about their symptoms and past medical history.
-Train your physical examination skills. Medcases is the only one among apps for medical students that offers an advanced algorithm for patient examination.

- Order additional tests. Aren’t you sure of your diagnosis? Perform CT, MRI, ultrasound, or any other test that can help you to make a correct medical diagnosis.
- Propose a medical diagnosis. When you have results of additional tests and accurate information about a patient’s condition, you can make a diagnosis. 
- Treat patients. After the correct medical diagnosis is made, you can propose a treatment for your patient. On the list of available treatment methods, you can see everything to treat your patient.  

At the end - check how did it go! After each diagnosed medical case, you will get a summary showing you which parts of a diagnostic/therapeutic process you have covered, and which of them need more practice.
Compare your result with other users - the summary will show you how hard the medical case was for others
