- Order additional tests. Aren’t you sure of your diagnosis? Perform CT, MRI, ultrasound, or any other test that can help you to make a correct medical diagnosis.
- Propose a medical diagnosis. When you have results of additional tests and accurate information about a patient’s condition, you can make a diagnosis. 
- Treat patients. After the correct medical diagnosis is made, you can propose a treatment for your patient. On the list of available treatment methods, you can see everything to treat your patient.  

At the end - check how did it go! After each diagnosed medical case, you will get a summary showing you which parts of a diagnostic/therapeutic process you have covered, and which of them need more practice.
Compare your result with other users - the summary will show you how hard the medical case was for others

com.google.android.apps.fitness,Google Fit: Activity Tracking,"Get to a healthier and more active life with the new Google Fit!

It's hard to know how much or what kind of activity you need to stay healthy. That's why Google Fit collaborated with the World Health Organization (WHO) and the American Heart Association (AHA) to bring you Heart Points, an activity goal that can help improve your health.

Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.

Google Fit will also help you:

TRACK YOUR WORKOUTS FROM YOUR PHONE OR WATCH
Get instant insights when you exercise and see real-time stats for your runs, walks, and bike rides. Fit will use your Android phone's sensors or Wear OS by Google smartwatch's heart rate sensors to record your speed, pace, route, and more.

MONITOR YOUR GOALS
See your daily progress on your Heart Points and Steps goal. Meeting your goals all the time? Easily adjust your goals to keep challenging yourself to achieve a healthy heart and mind.

MAKE ALL YOUR MOVEMENT COUNT
If you walk, run, or bike throughout the day, your Android phone or Wear OS by Google smartwatch will automatically detect and add your activities to your Google Fit journal to ensure you get credit for every move. Want extra credit? Turn up the tempo on your walks by starting a paced walking workout and stepping to the beat. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points you earn.

CONNECT WITH YOUR FAVORITE APPS AND DEVICES
Fit can show you info from many of your favorite apps and devices to give you a holistic view of your health, so you'll never lose track of your progress. These include Lifesum, Wear OS by Google, Nike+, Runkeeper, Strava, MyFitnessPal, Basis, Sleep as Android, Withings, Xiaomi Mi bands, and more.

Here are what a few people have said about RxGo:

Even with insurance inhalers have become so expensive I began to use mine sparingly –saving it for only really bad asthma attacks. Getting and using the RXGo discount coupon is crazy-easy, I pay a third what I would normally pay, and it has made a huge difference for my health and wallet. Told a friend about RXGo. She was using the “good” discount coupon service and is now saving much more than she did before. Shop around and you’ll see!
-   Tina

I work at a pharmacy and we often have people coming with discount cards from various companies in order to cut the cost of their medicine. We, at the pharmacy, often will take the coupon and compare it with other prices on other coupons for them to make sure we get them the lowest price. Since we’ve started using RxGo as one of the discount programs we check, we’ve all been amazed by how much more money it saves people on most prescriptions. It really does have the lowest price on almost everything we regularly dispense and still for the less common medicine too!

com.google.android.stardroid,Sky Map,"Sky Map is a hand-held planetarium for your Android device. Use it to identify stars, planets, nebulae and more. Originally developed as Google Sky Map, it has now been donated and open sourced.

<h1><b>Troubleshooting/FAQ</b></h1>
<h3><i>The Map doesn't move/points in the wrong place</i></h3>Make sure you haven't switched into manual mode. Does your phone have a compass? If not, Sky Map cannot tell your orientation. Look it up <a href=""http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gsmarena.com%2F&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0oehSII77IdlshQhZ3eg2I"">here:</a> http://www.gsmarena.com/ 

Try calibrating your compass by moving it in a figure of 8 motion or as described <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EPbAapaeI"">here:</a> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k1EPbAapaeI. 

Are there any magnets or metal nearby that might interfere with the compass? 

Try switching off ""magnetic correction"" (in settings) and see if that is more accurate.

<h3><i>Why is autolocation not supported for my phone?</i></h3>In Android 6 the way permissions work has changed. You need to enable the location permission setting for Sky Map as described <a href=""https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6270602?p=app_permissons_m"">here:</a> https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/6270602?p=app_permissons_m

<h3><i>The Map is jittery</i></h3> If you have a phone that lacks a gyro then some jitter is to be expected. Try adjusting the sensor speed and damping (in settings).

<h3><i>Do I need an internet connection?<i></i></i></h3> No, but some functions (like entering your location manually) won't work without one. You'll have to use the GPS or enter a latitude and longitude instead.
