2.	indicates trough a message the type and the basis system of the chosen fit;
3.	indicates trough a message if the selected fit is a preferable fit;
4.	indicates a highlighted message if the chosen fit is not an ISO standardized fit;
5.	easy to use by unexperienced users.
Upon entering the nominal dimension, the user selects the tolerance classes for holes and shafts, then the application provides, the complete information regarding the chosen fit, all relevant values including, type of fit, basis system, if it is a recommended or preferable fit and a graphical representation of the tolerance intervals.
It also prints the upper and lower limit deviations as well as the upper and lower limits of size according to ISO 286-2. 
Another useful feature is the language menu. When launched, the application will start in English, but if needed, if the user does not understand the terms in English, at a click of a button, Romanian, German or French can be used. This feature is available at any time, even after a fit has been calculated.
When selecting the basic hole in combination with the basic shaft, the application generates an additional message saying that the minimum clearance is 0.
If the user selects other tolerance grades that the ones recommended by ISO 286, the application will calculate the resulted fit, but it will also print a red highlighted message mentioning that the selected combination does not return an ISO standardized fit. The same message is generated if the user does not select a hole or a shaft basis system. When selecting other nominal dimensions that the ones listed in ISO 286-2, for each tolerance class, the application will generate a message indicating the interval for the selection of the nominal size.
To avoid supplementary costs by using too many tools and gauges when manufacturing the parts for the chosen fit, it is recommended that one of the preferable fits indicated according to ISO 286 should be chosen. ISO Checker also provides this information for the chosen fit.

com.msdsonline.eBinder,SDS / Chemical Management,"SDS/Chemical Management Mobile Application

Having immediate access to your hazardous chemical information is your key to maintaining a safe, compliant workplace. A compliant chemical inventory starts with knowing what materials are onsite, where they are used/ stored, their precise quantities, and ensuring each has an MSDS.

With VelocityEHS mobile capabilities, you can manage chemical inventory and ensure a safe and compliant workplace, all from a single application. Powered by your MSDSonline HQ or HQ RegXR account, the SDS/Chemical Management app —previously named ‘eBinder’- lets you locate and manage the contents of chemical containers in your workplace, as well as search your account for Safety Data Sheets and save them to your mobile device for offline use. 

Search and filter your account’s eBinder for quick access to the chemical safety information you need while you’re at work, whether that’s on- or off-site. Use your device’s camera to scan a barcode or QR Code label and retrieve information about the containers in your chemical inventory. Search the MSDSonline database to find an SDS that is not already in your eBinder. Use the app to edit the status of your containers, or move them throughout your organization. All changes automatically update the inventory in your online account. Scan UPC Codes associated with your products to retrieve product information and the product’s safety data sheet. 

Also, the chemical safety information associated with your containers downloads to your device and updates when new data or SDS versions are added to your eBinder. Whether you’re online or offline, you and your staff will always be just a few taps away from the hazardous chemical information necessary to maintaining a safe, compliant workplace. And you can rest assured that your SDS/Chemical Management mobile app is protected using the same username and password information as your MSDSonline account.

MSDSonline —a VelocityEHS solution— built its powerful chemical inventory management system to help you better meet regulatory reporting requirements under OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard. Now our mobile technology allows you to meet those requirements more quickly and efficiently. 

If you do not have a valid MSDSonline HQ or HQ RegXR account, please visit www.MSDSonline.com or call 1.888.362.2007.

com.orange.labs.draeneg,Draeneg,"Have you ever wanted to see what’s going on in the network, which and how data is used by applications? 

Draeneg is your trusted companion for monitoring network traffic for security, performance analysis, and data visualization purposes. Draeneg demystifies the data sent over the network by your (other) mobile applications. You gain complete control over your network traffic, ensuring the protection of your privacy. We also propose measurement of relevant performance metrics, covering networks as well as Web pages and mobile applications, to give you some insight into the quality of your experience on mobile Internet.

Here are the key features provided by 🦔 Draeneg.

🌐 <b>Network Monitoring</b>
• Monitor network activities in real time.
• List in detail all network connections between your device and the cloud.
• Filter network traffic per application, transport protocol, IP address or domain name.
• Network packet capture using the pcap format (for viewing with Wireshark).
• For Web pages, visualize HTTP archives (HAR) to get details of HTTP connections.
• Keep track of your current & past network data usage on your device. Detailed usage statistics are broken down per application, connection type (cellular vs Wi-Fi), and traffic type (upload vs download).

🔐 <b>Privacy & Security</b>
• Preserve your privacy with secure DNS servers by using the encrypted protocols DoQ (DNS over QUIC), DoH3 (DNS over HTTP/3), DoH (DNS over HTTPS) or DoT (DNS over TLS).
• Firewall features:
	• set up a parental control: i) keep your children away from adult and explicit content, or from using some websites/domains; ii) block applications from being used or accessing networks.
	• block dangerous (malware, phishing, crypto-mining) domains to protect you from unwanted or malicious content for a more secure and enhanced experience on Internet.

🚀 <b>Performance Analysis</b>
• Measure the quality of your network (cellular and Wi-Fi) signal to evaluate how good are your network connections. Generally speaking, you want a stronger network signal because it results in faster connection speeds and better service quality.
• Draeneg allows to measure a detailed list of performance metrics about 4G/5G cells. Note that cellular network monitoring is based on system APIs of the Android SDK which require you to grant the location permission. You can also use the application to perform an audit of cellular networks in the background (for example monitoring the cell signal during a long time period or over a long route by car, train, etc). To this end, you need to authorize access to the location in the background (which can be revoked at any time if you don’t need this feature anymore).

Master aviation RT with fully vocalised learning sessions and dynamically simulated practise flights. Whatever your current experience level, G-UDRT has the depth and breadth of content to ensure you can communicate with confidence.

RT knowledge and the ability to apply it competently is traditionally achieved through repeated exposure to and participation in diverse real-world radio communications. This can be challenging, especially for student pilots who can find their concentration is nearly entirely taken up by learning to fly the aircraft. There may be little mental capacity remaining to comprehend and remember all the airborne RT they hear.

With G-UDRT in your pocket, you can enjoy your expensive flight time, having mastered radiotelephony from the ground. Our content has been developed by a leading radiotelephony expert, and in consultation with those of us who are still improving.

Detailed learning content builds knowledge. Competence is achieved by practising using realistically unpredictable and fully vocalised simulated flights. You must respond to changing weather, traffic, clearances and more. Just like in the real world.

We provide 7 modules, 38 learning sessions and 20 simulated practise flights, covering the following subjects:
- The basics of radiotelephony (Free).
- Standard phraseology (Free).
- ATC, FIS, A/G Radio and unattended aerodrome RT (Free).
- Dealing with the unexpected.
- Circuit RT at ATC, FIS, A/G Radio and unattended aerodromes.
