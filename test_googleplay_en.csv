com.datzfain.IsoChecker,ISO Checker,"The developed Android application is able to calculate fits according to ISO 286 having the following features:
1.	multilingual (the results can be provided in Romanian, English, French and German);
2.	indicates trough a message the type and the basis system of the chosen fit;
3.	indicates trough a message if the selected fit is a preferable fit;
4.	indicates a highlighted message if the chosen fit is not an ISO standardized fit;
5.	easy to use by unexperienced users.
Upon entering the nominal dimension, the user selects the tolerance classes for holes and shafts, then the application provides, the complete information regarding the chosen fit, all relevant values including, type of fit, basis system, if it is a recommended or preferable fit and a graphical representation of the tolerance intervals.
It also prints the upper and lower limit deviations as well as the upper and lower limits of size according to ISO 286-2. 
Another useful feature is the language menu. When launched, the application will start in English, but if needed, if the user does not understand the terms in English, at a click of a button, Romanian, German or French can be used. This feature is available at any time, even after a fit has been calculated.
When selecting the basic hole in combination with the basic shaft, the application generates an additional message saying that the minimum clearance is 0.
If the user selects other tolerance grades that the ones recommended by ISO 286, the application will calculate the resulted fit, but it will also print a red highlighted message mentioning that the selected combination does not return an ISO standardized fit. The same message is generated if the user does not select a hole or a shaft basis system. When selecting other nominal dimensions that the ones listed in ISO 286-2, for each tolerance class, the application will generate a message indicating the interval for the selection of the nominal size.
To avoid supplementary costs by using too many tools and gauges when manufacturing the parts for the chosen fit, it is recommended that one of the preferable fits indicated according to ISO 286 should be chosen. ISO Checker also provides this information for the chosen fit.

com.msdsonline.eBinder,SDS / Chemical Management,"SDS/Chemical Management Mobile Application

Having immediate access to your hazardous chemical information is your key to maintaining a safe, compliant workplace. A compliant chemical inventory starts with knowing what materials are onsite, where they are used/ stored, their precise quantities, and ensuring each has an MSDS.

With VelocityEHS mobile capabilities, you can manage chemical inventory and ensure a safe and compliant workplace, all from a single application. Powered by your MSDSonline HQ or HQ RegXR account, the SDS/Chemical Management app —previously named ‘eBinder’- lets you locate and manage the contents of chemical containers in your workplace, as well as search your account for Safety Data Sheets and save them to your mobile device for offline use. 

Search and filter your account’s eBinder for quick access to the chemical safety information you need while you’re at work, whether that’s on- or off-site. Use your device’s camera to scan a barcode or QR Code label and retrieve information about the containers in your chemical inventory. Search the MSDSonline database to find an SDS that is not already in your eBinder. Use the app to edit the status of your containers, or move them throughout your organization. All changes automatically update the inventory in your online account. Scan UPC Codes associated with your products to retrieve product information and the product’s safety data sheet. 

Also, the chemical safety information associated with your containers downloads to your device and updates when new data or SDS versions are added to your eBinder. Whether you’re online or offline, you and your staff will always be just a few taps away from the hazardous chemical information necessary to maintaining a safe, compliant workplace. And you can rest assured that your SDS/Chemical Management mobile app is protected using the same username and password information as your MSDSonline account.

MSDSonline —a VelocityEHS solution— built its powerful chemical inventory management system to help you better meet regulatory reporting requirements under OSHA's Hazard Communication Standard. Now our mobile technology allows you to meet those requirements more quickly and efficiently. 

If you do not have a valid MSDSonline HQ or HQ RegXR account, please visit www.MSDSonline.com or call 1.888.362.2007.
