Start with the simplest organisms, then climb higher and higher up the tree of evolution: the evolution of species —> evolution of animals —> human evolution. Try to go through the evolution of the simplest species, be smart on the evolution of animals and be sure to fix the result of human evolution. Do not forget the main thing-to click!
The application is all for real: in the game you go through the evolution of the Proterozoic era to the modern world. Develop humanity and develop yourself. Click — go through the levels, earn coins and evolve. Click — get rewards for tasks, buy characters and evolve. You can accelerate evolution, but never stop! Evolution must continue!
And if you think you're almost done evolving, keep in mind that evolution never stops. It's an endless process of transformation where something new and exciting is always just about to appear. So keep on tapping, and new forms of life will fill the world of Evolution.
