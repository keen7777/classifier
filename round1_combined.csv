You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.

Activities that get your heart pumping harder have tremendous health benefits for your heart and mind. You'll earn one Heart Point for each minute of moderate activity like picking up the pace when walking your dog, and double points for more intense activities like running. It takes just 30-minutes of brisk walking five days a week to reach the AHA and WHO's recommended amount of physical activity shown to reduce the risk of heart disease, improve sleep, and increase overall mental wellbeing.

Want extra credit? Turn up the tempo on your walks by starting a paced walking workout and stepping to the beat. Enjoy a different type of workout? Select it from a list of activities like pilates, rowing, or spinning, and Google Fit will track all the Heart Points you earn.

Calm is recommended by top psychologists, therapists, mental health experts, and the press:

* “I’m generally wary of meditation apps because they sometimes weave in too much mystic talk for my taste. But Calm instead contains guidance like ‘Concentrate on your body’” - New York Times

* “In the frenetic, crazy, digital world we live in, sometimes it's necessary to take a step back and smell the roses” - Mashable
 
* “Eliminating distraction...ended up helping me relax and realize that all the stuff I was stressing about wasn't that big a deal” - Tech Republic",Health & Fitness,4.446044,"50,000,000+","Calm.com, Inc."

“I am so glad we decided to use this tracker app!!! The frequent newborn nighttime feedings turned my brain to mush. Keeping track of my little one's feedings helped so much. At 3 months, we decided to upgrade and track his sleep. He started sleeping through the night (8:30pm - 7:30am) within 3 days! Such a game changer!!! I HIGHLY recommend it!” - Georgette M

“This app is absolutely amazing! I started using it when my baby was first born to time pumping sessions. I then started tracking her feedings and now that she is coming up on two months old I've started tracking her sleep. All the features other than sleep are completely free and we will definitely be getting premium now that we are tracking sleep!” - Sara S.

The harm reduction approach follows from the idea that substance use is a high-risk activity that innately entails the possibility of injury, addiction, and death. Therefore, the best strategy one can employ (outside of avoiding use entirely) is to take appropriate measures to mitigate its potential harms.

KnowDrugs highlights the harm-potential of more than 200 substances and demonstrates strategies on how to reduce the harms associated with the consumption of drugs.

KNOWDRUGS CAN ALSO HELP YOU  TO:

- learn how to spot and react in case of an emergency, take care of someone experiencing a bad trip at a party or festival
- find a free and confidential counselling service which accepts you and your personal choices, and helps you develop the right strategies and competencies if you want to change something about your consumption behaviour.",Education,4.16,"500,000+",Plant Product Design

com.flowneuroscience.flow.droid,Flow - Depression treatment,"The Flow depression treatment is a free personal guide to help you understand and improve your mental health.

Flow represents a new chapter in the understanding and treatment of depression, based on the latest psychology and neuroscience research.

The app can be used on its own and offers an education programme with over 50 sessions. The sessions cover a range of topics from behavioural coaching and lifestyle habits, such as, meditation, sleep, diet and exercise. To track changes over time, the app includes the MADRS-s depression test.

Used as a companion tool for the Flow brain stimulation headset, this is a holistic approach to treating depression. The type of stimulation used in the Flow headset, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has long been used in clinical settings to treat depression. With Flow, you can now access tDCS in a remote device from your own home. To use the headset you will need the app.

The Flow treatment is based on decades of clinical research and is supported by more than 20 randomised double-blind studies. The Flow headset is approved as a medical device (CE) in the EU and UK for the treatment of depression. Order it at: https://flowneuroscience.com

The programme contains over 50 education sessions split into 7 courses, covering topics such as:

- Exercise

Physical exercise has been shown to have a similar effect to antidepressant medication when it comes to reducing and preventing depressive symptoms. Flow education explores the types of exercise that are beneficial.

- Meditation

Meditation is practised by many people around the world as mental “exercise” for the brain. Flow will give you exercises to follow but also show you the neurological basis of why meditation is good for managing stress in your everyday life.

- Sleep

Did you know that sleeping for only six hours each night for two nights in a row is equivalent to being continuously awake for 24 hours? Flow will educate you on sleep hygiene, why we sleep and why sleeping is one of four important pillars for overcoming depression.

- Nutrition

com.rxgo,RxGo: Prescription Rx Coupons,"Save up to 80% on prescription medication. 

Compare prescription drug prices and discover hundreds of coupons & discounts. 


Pharmaceutical pricing has always been extremely opaque. A lifesaving medication may cost $100 at one pharmacy and $10 at another. RxGo.com understands that high medication costs can prove to be an extreme financial hardship for many hard-working families across the US.

Our software allows everyone to compare pricing at nearby pharmacies and print coupons to further lower their costs. Since its inception in 2012 RxGo has saved patients tens of millions of dollars.

Here are what a few people have said about RxGo:

Even with insurance inhalers have become so expensive I began to use mine sparingly –saving it for only really bad asthma attacks. Getting and using the RXGo discount coupon is crazy-easy, I pay a third what I would normally pay, and it has made a huge difference for my health and wallet. Told a friend about RXGo. She was using the “good” discount coupon service and is now saving much more than she did before. Shop around and you’ll see!
-   Tina

I work at a pharmacy and we often have people coming with discount cards from various companies in order to cut the cost of their medicine. We, at the pharmacy, often will take the coupon and compare it with other prices on other coupons for them to make sure we get them the lowest price. Since we’ve started using RxGo as one of the discount programs we check, we’ve all been amazed by how much more money it saves people on most prescriptions. It really does have the lowest price on almost everything we regularly dispense and still for the less common medicine too!
-	Ryan K.
